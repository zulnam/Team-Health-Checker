## About

Customisable in-house tool for companies, groups or organisations in order to gather, store and compare team metrics based solely on teams (user voting is anonymous).

This tool will create sessions where users can vote on predefined questions using three options: Agree, Disagree and Neutral.
Once the session is complete a report is created, showing all votes on questions along with the latest trend for that question, if a previous report exists.

Data storage will be handled using NoSQL and DynamoDB.

_All features below are set to release prior to version 1._
